","body":"fontCDN\r\n=======\r\n\r\nServe webfonts from your own server! \r\nfontCDN is a simple solution to deliver web fonts written in php. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Why would I need this?\r\nAs a web developer, you most probably use non-system fonts from Google Fonts or Typekit. Now, while those are awesome and blazingly fast and all, sometimes you need a font just not hosted on any major CDN, so you host it on the domain yourself.  \r\n\r\nThis drags your speed down quite a bit, depending on the amount of fonts and styles and file formats you need. Throw in images, svg and script files - websites can become pretty demanding.\r\n\r\n## So, what does it do?\r\nfontCDN behaves a bit like Google Fonts:  \r\nTo make a certain font available, you include a css file in your document head. The link is constructed from multiple parameters, like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://static.example.com/fonts/Roboto\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout parameters, the returned css will default to the _normal_-font-style and font-weight _400_, including only the required file type based on the clients user agent. For a current build of Google Chrome, the css would look like this:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@font-face {\r\n  font-family: \"Roboto\";\r\n  font-style: normal;\r\n  font-weight: 400;\r\n  src: local(\"Roboto\"), local(\"Roboto\"), url(https://static.example.com/files/fonts/Roboto/Roboto-normal.woff2) format(\"woff2\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo get more styles or even fonts at once, alter the URL like this:\r\n```\r\nhttps://static.example.com/fonts/Roboto|italic:600,normal:300&Open+Sans|normal:100\r\n```\r\nThis will include three @font-face - blocks, each with their respective file name.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n***\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIt even catches common errors and informs about it by inserting a css comment in the output:\r\n```\r\nhttps://static.example.com/fonts/RObOtO|normal:120000&Source+Code+Pro|fancy\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will resolve to font name Roboto, set its weight to 900 (maximum value by the specs), set the font-style for Source Code Pro to normal and add font-weight 400 to it:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/* Requested weight 120000 is too high, falling back to 900 */\r\n/* Requested style fancy not available, falling back to normal */\r\n/* No weight specified, falling back to 400 */\r\n@font-face {\r\n  font-family: \"Roboto\";\r\n  font-style: normal;\r\n  font-weight: 900;\r\n  src: local(\"Roboto\"), local(\"Roboto\"), url(http://static.9dev.de/files/fonts/Roboto/Roboto-normal.woff2) format(\"woff2\");\r\n}\r\n\r\n@font-face {\r\n  font-family: \"Source Code Pro\";\r\n  font-style: normal;\r\n  font-weight: 400;\r\n  src: local(\"Source Code Pro\"), local(\"SourceCodePro\"), url(http://static.9dev.de/files/fonts/SourceCodePro/SourceCodePro-normal.woff2) format(\"woff2\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Is it complete yet?\r\nNot by any measure. The configuration for what font styles to use, browsers to support, URLs to build etc etc. is still buried in the script. There should be a global config file. While this _can_ be used to only serve fonts, a snippet for svg files is already included, more to come.\r\n\r\nParticipation would be gladly recieved! I am by no means a php professional (as you maybe are able to tell from looking at the code - it's pretty rough ATM).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
